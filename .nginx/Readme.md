# Dedicated Nginx docker and configuration

from the current directory, (`**/.nginx/) run the following command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Launch the app with localhost port 8000.
It should be available at http://localhost:80 once you compose the docker.

For custom configuration, you can copy the nginx.conf file and customize it to your need.
